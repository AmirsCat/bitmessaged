bitmessaged
===========

bitmessaged is a bitmessage daemon (node) with an open plugin interface written in C++
it is stii in development, so you should not try to use it at this stage.

But if you are interested in the project you can look into the sources.

bitmessaged is written with Astade (http://astade.de) which is a C++ code generator. 
If you clone this repository you need to install Astade to get the source files generated.

If you want to skip this step, go to

and

http://buildbot.dyn.astade.de:8080/view/bitmessaged/job/bitmessaged/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/model/Components_bitmessaged/Component_bitmessaged/manual/

and download the generated sources.
